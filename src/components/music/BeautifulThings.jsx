            For a while there, it was rough<br/>
            But lately, I've been doin' better<br/>
            Than the last four cold Decembers I recall<br/>
            And I see my family every month<br/>
            I found a girl my parents love<br/>
            She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all<br/>
            And I thank God every day<br/>
            For the girl He sent my way<br/>
            But I know the things He gives me, He can take away<br/>
            And I hold you every night<br/>
            And that's a feeling I wanna get used to<br/>
            But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you<br/>
            <br/>
            Oh, I hope I don't lose you<br/>
            Mm, please stay<br/>
            I want you, I need you, oh God<br/>
            Don't take<br/>
            These beautiful things that I've got<br/>
            <br/>
            Please stay<br/>
            I want you, I need you, oh, God<br/>
            Don't take<br/>
            These beautiful things that I've got<br/>
            <br/>
            Oh, ooh<br/>
            Please don't take<br/>
            <br/>
            I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane<br/>
            It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith<br/>
            If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?<br/>
            Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough<br/>
            I've got peace and I've got love<br/>
            But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all<br/>
            <br/>
            Please stay<br/>
            I want you, I need you, oh God<br/>
            Don't take<br/>
            These beautiful things that I've got<br/>
            <br/>
            Oh, ooh<br/>
            <br/>
            Please stay<br/>
            I want you, I need you, oh God<br/>
            I need<br/>
            These beautiful things that I've got
