            Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars<br/>
            I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought<br/>
            You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?<br/>
            Know you're all that I want this life<br/>
            <br/>
            I'll imagine we fell in love<br/>
            I'll nap under moonlight skies with you<br/>
            I think I'll picture us, you with the waves<br/>
            The oceans colors on your face<br/>
            I'll leave my heart with your air<br/>
            So let me fly with you<br/>
            Will you be forever with me?<br/>
            <br/>
            My love will always stay by you<br/>
            I'll keep it safe so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more<br/>
            It's stuck with you forever so promise you won't let it go<br/>
            I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you<br/>
            <br/>
            I'll imagine we fell in love<br/>
            I'll nap under moonlight skies with you<br/>
            I think I'll picture us, you with the waves<br/>
            The oceans colors on your face<br/>
            I'll leave my heart with your air<br/>
            So let me fly with you<br/>Will you be forever with me?
