            Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
                        Dreaming about the things that we could be<br/>
                        But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br/>
                        Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars<br/>
                        Yeah, we'll be counting stars<br/>
                        <br/>
                        I see this life like a swinging vine<br/>
                        Swing my heart across the line<br/>
                        And in my face is flashing signs<br/>
                        Seek it out and ye shall find<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Old but I'm not that old<br/>
                        Young but I'm not that bold<br/>
                        And I don't think the world is sold<br/>
                        On just doing what we're told<br/>
                        <br/>
                        I feel something so right doing the wrong thing<br/>
                        And I feel something so wrong doing the right thing<br/>
                        I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie<br/>
                        Everything that kills me makes me feel alive<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
                        Dreaming about the things that we could be<br/>
                        But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard<br/>
                        Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars<br/>
                        <br/>

                        <br/>
                        I feel your love, and I feel it burn<br/>
                        Down this river every turn<br/>
                        Hope is our four-letter word<br/>
                        Make that money, watch it burn<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Old, but I'm not that old<br/>

                        And I don't think the world is sold<br/>

                        I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie<br/>
                        Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly<br/>
                        <br/>
