            (Ooh, ooh)<br/>
           <br/>
           I, I just woke up from a dream<br/>
           Where you and I had to say goodbye<br/>
           And I don't know what it all means<br/>
           But since I survived, I realized<br/>
           <br/>
           Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br/>
           Nobody's promised tomorrow<br/>
           So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night<br/>
           Like it's the last night<br/>
           <br/>
           If the world was ending<br/>
           I'd wanna be next to you<br/>
           If the party was over<br/>
           And our time on Earth was through<br/>
           I'd wanna hold you just for a while<br/>
           And die with a smile<br/>
           If the world was ending<br/>
           I'd wanna be next to you<br/>
           <br/>
           (Ooh, ooh)<br/>
           <br/>
           Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream<br/>
           I don't even wanna do this anymore<br/>
           'Cause you already know what you mean to me<br/>
           And our love's the only war worth fighting for<br/>
           <br/>
           Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br/>
           Nobody's promised tomorrow<br/>
           So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night<br/>
           Like it's the last night<br/>
           <br/>
           If the world was ending<br/>
           I'd wanna be next to you<br/>
           If the party was over<br/>
           And our time on Earth was through<br/>
           I'd wanna hold you just for a while<br/>
           And die with a smile<br/>
           If the world was ending<br/>
           I'd wanna be next to you<br/>
           <br/>
           Right next to you<br/>
           Next to you<br/>
           Right next to you<br/>
           Oh-oh<br/>
           <br/>
           If the world was ending<br/>
           I'd wanna be next to you<br/>
