            It was just two lovers<br/>
            Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other<br/>
            Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover<br/>
            Missed call from my mother<br/>
            Like, &quot;Where you at tonight?&quot;<br/>
            Got no alibi, I was all alone<br/>
            <br/>
            With the love of my life<br/>
            She's got glitter for skin<br/>
            My radiant beam in the night<br/>
            I don't need no light to see you<br/>
            <br/>
            Shine<br/>
            It's your golden hour<br/>
            You slow down time<br/>
            In your golden hour<br/>
            <br/>
            We were just two lovers<br/>
            Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer<br/>
            Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power<br/>
            Minutes feel like hours<br/>
            She knew she was the baddest<br/>
            Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?<br/>
            <br/>
            For the love of my life<br/>
            She's got glow on her face<br/>
            A glorious look in her eyes<br/>
            My angel of light<br/>
            <br/>
            I was all alone with the love of my life<br/>
            She's got glitter for skin<br/>
            My radiant beam in the night<br/>
            I don't need no light to see you<br/>
            <br/>
            Shine<br/>
            It's your golden hour<br/>
            You slow down time<br/>In your golden hour
