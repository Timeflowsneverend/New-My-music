            Now I've heard there was a secret chord<br/>
                        That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br/>
                        But you don't really care for music, do you?<br/>
                        It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br/>
                        The minor fall, the major lift<br/>
                        The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br/>
                        You saw her bathing on the roof<br/>
                        Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br/>
                        She tied you to a kitchen chair<br/>
                        She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br/>
                        And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        You say I took the name in vain<br/>
                        I don't even know the name<br/>
                        But if I did—well, really—what's it to you?<br/>
                        There's a blaze of light in every word<br/>
                        It doesn't matter which you heard<br/>
                        The holy or the broken Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        I did my best, it wasn't much<br/>
                        I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch<br/>
                        I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you<br/>
                        And even though it all went wrong<br/>
                        I'll stand before the Lord of Song<br/>
                        With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
