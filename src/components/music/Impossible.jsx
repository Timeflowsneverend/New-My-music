            I remember years ago<br/>
            Someone told me I should take<br/>
            Caution when it comes to love<br/>
            I did<br/>
            <br/>
            And you were strong and I was not<br/>
            My illusion, my mistake<br/>
            I was careless, I forgot<br/>
            I did<br/>
            <br/>
            And now when all is done<br/>
            There is nothing to say<br/>
            You have gone and so effortlessly<br/>
            You have won<br/>
            You can go ahead tell them<br/>
            <br/>
            Tell them all I know now<br/>
            Shout it from the roof tops<br/>
            Write it on the skyline<br/>
            All we had is gone now<br/>
            Tell them I was happy<br/>
            And my heart is broken<br/>
            All my scars are open<br/>
            Tell them what I hoped would be<br/>
            Impossible, impossible<br/>
            Impossible, impossible<br/>
            <br/>
            Falling out of love is hard<br/>
            Falling for betrayal is worse<br/>
            Broken trust and broken hearts<br/>
            I know, I know<br/>
            <br/>
            Thinking all you need is there<br/>
            Building faith on love and words<br/>
            Empty promises will wear<br/>
            I know, I know<br/>
            <br/>
            And now when all is done<br/>
            There is nothing to say<br/>
            <br/>
            And if you're done with embarrassing me<br/>
            On your own you can go ahead tell them<br/>
            <br/>
            Tell them all I know now<br/>
            Shout it from the roof tops<br/>
            Write it on the skyline<br/>
            All we had is gone now<br/>
            Tell them I was happy<br/>
            And my heart is broken<br/>
            All my scars are open<br/>
            Tell them what I hoped would be<br/>
            Impossible, impossible<br/>
            Impossible, impossible<br/>
            <br/>
            I remember years ago<br/>
            Someone told me I should take<br/>

            <br/>
            Tell them I was happy<br/>
            And my heart is broken<br/>
            (Tell them oh) I hoped would be<br/>
            Impossible, impossible<br/>
            Impossible, impossible<br/>
