            This night is cold in the kingdom<br/>
            I can feel you fade away<br/>
            From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and<br/>
            Your steps keep me awake<br/>
            <br/>
            Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste<br/>
            I once was a man with dignity and grace<br/>
            Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace<br/>
            So please, please<br/>
            <br/>
            Could you find a way to let me down slowly?<br/>
            A little sympathy, I hope you can show me<br/>
            <br/>
            If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br/>
            If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly<br/>
            <br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down<br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down<br/>
            <br/>
            If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely<br/>
            If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly<br/>
            <br/>
            Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile<br/>
            As I'm walking down the corridor<br/>
            And I know we haven't talked in a while<br/>
            So I'm looking for an open door<br/>
            <br/>
            Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste<br/>
            I once was a man with dignity and grace<br/>
            Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace<br/>
            So please, please<br/>
            <br/>

            A little sympathy, I hope you can show me<br/>

            If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly<br/>
            <br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down<br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down, down<br/>
            Let me down<br/>

            If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly<br/>
            <br/>
            And I can't stop myself from falling down<br/>
            And I can't stop myself from falling down<br/>
            And I can't stop myself from falling down<br/>
