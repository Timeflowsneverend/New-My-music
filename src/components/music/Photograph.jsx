            Loving can hurt<br/>
            Loving can hurt sometimes<br/>
            But it's the only thing that I know<br/>
            When it gets hard<br/>
            You know it can get hard sometimes<br/>
            It is the only thing that makes us feel alive<br/>
            <br/>
            We keep this love in a photograph<br/>
            We made these memories for ourselves<br/>
            Where our eyes are never closing<br/>
            Hearts are never broken<br/>
            Times forever frozen still<br/>
            <br/>
            So you can keep me<br/>
            Inside the pocket<br/>
            Of your ripped jeans<br/>
            Holding me closer<br/>
            'Til our eyes meet<br/>
            You won't ever be alone<br/>
            Wait for me to come home<br/>
            <br/>
            Loving can heal<br/>
            Loving can mend your soul<br/>
            And it's the only thing that I know (know)<br/>
            I swear it will get easier<br/>
            Remember that with every piece of ya<br/>
            And it's the only thing we take with us when we die<br/>
            <br/>
            We keep this love in a photograph<br/>
            We made these memories for ourselves<br/>
            Where our eyes are never closing<br/>
            Hearts were never broken<br/>
            Times forever frozen still<br/>
            <br/>
            So you can keep me<br/>
            Inside the pocket<br/>
            Of your ripped jeans<br/>
            Holding me closer<br/>
            'Til our eyes meet<br/>
            You won't ever be alone<br/>
            <br/>
            And if you hurt me<br/>
            That's OK, baby, only words bleed<br/>
            Inside these pages you just hold me<br/>
            And I won't ever let you go<br/>
            <br/>
            Wait for me to come home<br/>
            Wait for me to come home<br/>
            Wait for me to come home<br/>
            Wait for me to come home<br/>
            <br/>
            Oh you can fit me<br/>
            Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br/>
            Next to your heartbeat<br/>
            Where I should be<br/>
            Keep it deep within your soul<br/>
            <br/>
            And if you hurt me<br/>
            Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed<br/>
            Inside these pages you just hold me<br/>
            And I won't ever let you go<br/>
            <br/>
            When I'm away<br/>
            I will remember how you kissed me<br/>
            Under the lamppost<br/>
            Back on 6th street<br/>
            Hearing you whisper through the phone<br/>&quot;Wait for me to come home &quot;
