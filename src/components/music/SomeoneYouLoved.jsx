            I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me<br/>
            This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy<br/>
            <br/>
            I need somebody to heal<br/>
            Somebody to know<br/>
            Somebody to have<br/>
            Somebody to hold<br/>
            It's easy to say<br/>
            But it's never the same<br/>
            I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain<br/>
            <br/>
            Now the day bleeds<br/>
            Into nightfall<br/>
            And you're not here<br/>
            To get me through it all<br/>
            I let my guard down<br/>
            And then you pulled the rug<br/>
            I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br/>
            <br/>
            I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to<br/>
            This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you<br/>
            <br/>
            Now, I need somebody to know<br/>
            Somebody to heal<br/>
            Somebody to have<br/>
            Just to know how it feels<br/>
            It's easy to say<br/>
            But it's never the same<br/>
            I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape<br/>
            <br/>
            Now the day bleeds<br/>
            Into nightfall<br/>
            And you're not here<br/>
            To get me through it all<br/>
            I let my guard down<br/>
            And then you pulled the rug<br/>
            I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br/>
            <br/>
            And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes<br/>
            I fall into your arms<br/>
            I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around<br/>
            <br/>
            For now the day bleeds<br/>
            Into nightfall<br/>
            And you're not here<br/>
            To get me through it all<br/>
            I let my guard down<br/>
            And then you pulled the rug<br/>
            I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br/>
            <br/>
            But now the day bleeds<br/>
            Into nightfall<br/>
            And you're not here<br/>
            To get me through it all<br/>
            I let my guard down<br/>
            And then you pulled the rug<br/>
            I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br/>
