            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh (ooh)<br/>
            Ayy, ayy<br/>

            Needless to say, I keep in check<br/>
            She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)<br/>
            Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)<br/>
            Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)<br/>
            <br/>
            Needless to say, I'm keepin' in check<br/>
            She was a bad-bad, nevertheless<br/>
            Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck<br/>
            Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck<br/>
            <br/>
            Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip<br/>
            Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip<br/>
            Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt<br/>
            Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt<br/>
            <br/>
            Ooh-ooh<br/>
            Some things you just can't refuse<br/>
            She wanna ride me like a cruise<br/>
            And I'm not tryna lose<br/>
            <br/>
            Then you're left in the dust<br/>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br/>
            You're a sunflower<br/>
            I think your love would be too much<br/>
            Or you'll be left in the dust<br/>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br/>
            You're the sunflower<br/>
            You're the sunflower<br/>

            <i>[Post Malone:]</i>
            <br/>
            Every time I'm leavin' on you<br/>
            You don't make it easy, no, no<br/>
            Wish I could be there for you<br/>
            Give me a reason to, oh, oh <br/>
            <br/>
            Every time I'm walkin' out<br/>
            I can hear you tellin' me to turn around<br/>
            Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down<br/>
            Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh<br/>
            <br/>
            I know you're scared of the unknown (-known)<br/>
            You don't wanna be alone (alone)<br/>
            I know I always come and go (and go)<br/>
            But it's out of my control<br/>
            <br/>
            And you'll be left in the dust<br/>
            Unless I stuck by ya<br/>
            You're the sunflower<br/>
            I think your love would be too much<br/>
            Or you'll be left in the dust<br/>
